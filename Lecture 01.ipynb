    "Machine Learning has become the backbone of modern decision-making systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before businesses had access to intelligent models, most decisions were made using **manually coded rules**, **experience-based heuristics**, and **simple statistical summaries**. These methods worked well for small, structured problems, but they could not handle the massive scale, variety, and complexity of real-world data.\n",

    "## **A Short History of Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning emerged as a natural evolution of statistics and computer science. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the early days, systems relied heavily on **explicit programming** every condition and rule had to be written by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As data grew rapidly, rule-based systems became difficult to maintain and often failed to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Researchers then shifted to algorithms that **learn patterns automatically from data** instead of depending on fixed logic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Over time, this field expanded into `supervised learning`, `unsupervised learning`, `reinforcement learning`, and `deep learning`, enabling machines to understand text, images, speech, human behavior, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Machine Learning is used across industries finance, healthcare, retail, marketing, aviation, manufacturing—to automate decisions, predict future outcomes, and uncover hidden patterns that traditional analytics cannot detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Do We Use Machine Learning?**\n",
    "We use ML because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is too large and complex for manual analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Human-written rules cannot capture dynamic patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ML models adapt, learn, and improve with more data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ML provides **accurate predictions**, **automation**, and **data-driven decision capabilities**.  \n",

    "## **Purpose of This Notebook**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- What ML actually is  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Types of learning  \n",

    "- When to use classification, regression, clustering, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Which algorithm fits which type of problem  \n",
    "\n",
    "- How models interpret data and make predictions  \n",
